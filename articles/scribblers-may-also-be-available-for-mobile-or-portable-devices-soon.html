<p>What is this all about <a href="https://scribblers-official.herokuapp.com/">Scribble.rs</a> may be available for mobile or specifically for portable devices soon and why is it important?</p>
<p>In short <a href="https://scribblers-official.herokuapp.com/">Scribble.rs</a> is an online multiplayer browser game written in Go, JavaScript and HTML. The primary goal of this game is that it should run on any Desktop device. However there is no official support for mobile or portable devices.</p>
<p>There have been people who played <a href="https://scribblers-official.herokuapp.com/">Scribble.rs</a> on their iPad's and they report that this game is somewhat playable.</p>
<p>Many people have smartphones nowadays that are online 24/7, and people are interested in playing this game on their smartphones or tablets.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/scribble-rs/ScribblersPad">Scribble.rs Pad</a> is a project I started developing to fill this gap.</p>
<p>It is not possible to copy <a href="https://scribblers-official.herokuapp.com/">Scribble.rs</a> current user interface one by one and call it a day, therefore a mobile or portable client has to be designed differently. <a href="https://github.com/scribble-rs/ScribblersPad">Scribble.rs Pad</a> is a <a href="https://scribblers-official.herokuapp.com/">Scribble.rs</a> client and more made in Unity Game Engine. The goal here is to provide the experience of <a href="https://scribblers-official.herokuapp.com/">Scribble.rs</a> for your mobile or portable devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/scribble-rs/ScribblersPad">Scribble.rs Pad</a> is going to stay free and open-source and will be available on app stores once it has been released.</p>
