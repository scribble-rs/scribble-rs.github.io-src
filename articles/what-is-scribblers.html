<p>What is <a href="https://scribblers-official.herokuapp.com/">Scribble.rs</a> and how to play it?</p>
<p><a href="https://scribblers-official.herokuapp.com/">Scribble.rs</a> is an online multiplayer browser game written in Go, JavaScript and HTML. The main goal is to guess as fast as possible what someone is drawing. In the other hand as drawer you want to draw a word even if they may be concepts that can't be drawn in one go as fast and understandable as possible.</p>
<p>The more people are in a lobby, the more fun you experience. This game is designed to be enjoyed by many people.</p>
<p>You can start playing <a href="https://scribblers-official.herokuapp.com/">Scribble.rs</a> by clicking on this link: <a href="https://scribblers-official.herokuapp.com/">https://scribblers-official.herokuapp.com/</a></p>
<p>This project started as an alternative to <a href="https://skribbl.io/">skribbl.io</a>, where the main problems are that the project's source is closed, ads being displayed and probably run trackers on your browser, a poor points system where you could loose all of your points if you have timed out. The automatic word choice system is quite annoying and may cause frustration.</p>
<p><a href="https://scribblers-official.herokuapp.com/">Scribble.rs</a> goal is to stay open-source, free of any ads, improving on features <a href="https://skribbl.io/">skribbl.io</a> has failed to deliver.</p>
<p>Additionally <a href="https://scribblers-official.herokuapp.com/">Scribble.rs</a> provides an open API, so developers could make their own clients to communicate with <a href="https://scribblers-official.herokuapp.com/">Scribble.rs</a> servers. We will surely see more third party clients coming up in the future.</p>
